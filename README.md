# Collection of algorithms written in Java
Me practicing my Java Coding. Made to be edited with JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  Uses the developer version of Java JDK 16 (https://jdk.java.net/16/). Changelogs are included in the .java file in the src/com/AdamT folder.
## Usage
* ### Source Code
	1. Ensure you have Java JDK 16 (https://jdk.java.net/16/) downloaded and ready for use by your IDE (or manual `cmd.exe`/Linux Terminal compiler). This program was compiled and written with JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), so I would recommend using this (although it is not an absolute must).
	2. In the box above, select `Download Code` and then `Download ZIP`.
	3. Extract the contents of the folder to a directory of your choice, renaming `ALevelCSPractice-master` to `ALevelCSPractice`.
	4. 
		* If using an IDE: Open the `ALevelCSPractice` in your IDE as a project.
		* If using a text editor program and compiling the manual way: Open the `CompSci.java` file in `ALevelCSPractice-master\src\com\AdamT` with a text editor of your choice.
	5. You can now take a look at how I have designed my program. If you are looking at an older version (say, `0.2.0.1`) you can laugh at my poor programming techniques.
* ### JAR File
	1. Select the latest release from https://github.com/SimPilotAdamT/ALevelCSPractice/releases/ and download the JAR File.
	2. Run the JAR file from `cmd.exe` or the Linux Terminal.
